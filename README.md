# morse-code-decoder
This repository contains a C program that creates a binary tree to store and decode Morse code. Each letter of the alphabet is represented in the tree structure using dots and dashes.

## Features
**Binary Tree Structure**: Uses a binary tree to represent Morse code.
**Insertion and Search**: Functions to insert and search letters in the tree using Morse code.
**Interactive Input**: Accepts Morse code input and decodes it in real-time.
## Files
**main.c**: The main C program containing the implementation.
## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
GCC compiler
